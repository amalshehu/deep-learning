- Try to implement what you learned during the day

## Homework (Post 2-Day Plan)
- **Project Completion**: Finish any remaining project work
- **Resource Gathering**: Compile a list of resources (books, courses, etc.) for deeper learning
- **Community Engagement**: Begin engaging with the community by joining relevant forums and groups

## Note
- **Breaks**: Ensure to take short breaks between sessions to avoid burnout
- **Practical Implementation**: Focus on hands-on experience; the more you practice, the better you understand
- **Documentation**: Document your learning process; it will be a helpful resource in the future
